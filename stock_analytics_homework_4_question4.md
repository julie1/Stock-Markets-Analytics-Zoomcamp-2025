Since my capital is limited and my strategy is not purely theoretical, I might try to invest \$50 in an index fund like the S&P and \$100 in a portfolio of stocks that I would predict to be tariff 
Instead of 30 days, I would make my predictions for at least 3 months and possibly longer and would make the threshhold for a positive prediction higher\n",
to limit transaction fees.  I might vary the 1/3 ratio of passive to active to make more predictions.  The best predictions would require less than 5 trades per year and with a CAGR >= 1.12.  I might have to adjust my portfolio to obtain this.  I would need to try various ML models as well.
